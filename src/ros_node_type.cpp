/**
 * @file ros_utils.cpp
 * @author  Julian Rendon (julianrendon514@gmail.com)
 * @brief Empty cpp file used to create ros_utils library.
 * @version 0.1
 * @date 2022-11-11
 *
 * Created an empty cpp file so that it can be linked with the appropriate header file. Without
 * this cpp file, it was challenging to figure out how to install this libary so that other ROS
 * packages could use it.
